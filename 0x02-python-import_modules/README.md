# Python Import and Modules 🐍🧩

## Introduction
In Python, modules are like toolboxes filled with functions and variables that you can use in your programs. Importing allows you to use code from other files, making your program organized and efficient. Let's explore some tasks that involve importing and using modules. 🚀

## Task 0: Import a Simple Function
**Description:** Write a program that imports the function `add(a, b)` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`. 📊

**Tips:**
1. Use the `import` keyword to import the module (`add_0`) into your program.
2. Call the `add` function from the module with the required arguments.
3. Utilize the `print` function with string formatting to display the result. 🖨️

## Task 1: My First Toolbox!
**Description:** Write a program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, performs mathematical operations, and prints the results. 🔢

**Tips:**
1. Import the necessary functions from the `calculator_1` module.
2. Use variables `a` and `b` to perform mathematical operations.
3. Print the results using the `print` function with appropriate formatting. 🎲

## Task 2: How to Make a Script Dynamic!
**Description:** Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments. 📝

**Tips:**
1. Import the necessary module to access command-line arguments.
2. Utilize `len()` to get the number of arguments.
3. Iterate through the arguments and print their positions and values. 🔄

## Task 3: Infinite Addition
**Description:** Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments. ➕

**Tips:**
1. Import the module required for handling command-line arguments.
2. Cast the arguments to integers using `int()` and perform addition.
3. Print the result using the `print` function. 🖨️

## Task 4: Who Are You?
**Description:** Write a program that prints all names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`. 🕵️‍♂️

**Tips:**
1. Use the `import` statement to import the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
2. Explore the contents of the module using the appropriate approach.
3. Print the names meeting the specified conditions. 📜

## Task 5: Everything Can Be Imported
**Description:** Write a program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value. 🔄

**Tips:**
1. Use the `import` statement to import the variable `a` from the module.
2. Print the value of the variable `a` using the `print` function. 🖨️

Remember to carefully read the task descriptions and use the correct functions and methods for each task. Also, pay attention to the specific requirements mentioned in each task. 🧐
