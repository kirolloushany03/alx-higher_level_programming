# ALX Higher Level Programming Repository

Welcome to the ALX Higher Level Programming repository! This repository is designed for learning and practicing high-level programming languages such as Python and C. Additionally, we leverage the power of Bash scripting for automation, making tasks easier and more efficient.

## Contents

1. **Python Programming:**
   - In this section, you will find Python scripts covering various topics in high-level programming. These scripts are designed to help you understand and practice Python concepts.

2. **C Programming:**
   - Explore the world of C programming with a set of C source code files. These files are structured to guide you through fundamental concepts in C, paving the way for a deeper understanding of low-level programming.

3. **Data Structures:**
   - As you progress, you will encounter folders dedicated to data structures. Here, you can find implementations of different data structures in both Python and C. These implementations aim to strengthen your understanding of data organization and manipulation.

4. **Bash Scripts:**
   - Automation is a key skill in programming. The `bash_scripts` directory contains various Bash scripts that automate common tasks. These scripts can be customized and utilized to streamline your workflow.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
