# Python - if/else, loops, functions

Welcome to the world of Python! 🐍 This set of tasks introduces you to fundamental concepts in Python programming, focusing on if/else statements, loops, and functions. Let's dive into the creative realm of coding and explore these concepts in an engaging way.

## Positive Anything is Better than Negative Nothing (Task 0)

**Objective:** Understand if/else statements

In this task, we explore the positivity of numbers. The program generates a random signed number and showcases the power of if/else statements in determining whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. Feel the randomness, embrace the logic!

## The Last Digit (Task 1)

**Objective:** More if/else fun!

Here, we continue our journey with if/else statements. A random number is chosen, and we extract its last digit. Depending on this digit, we provide insightful information about its greatness or lack thereof. Dive into the world of number analysis and discover the magic of conditionals!

## I Sometimes Suffer from Insomnia... (Task 2)

**Objective:** Mastering loops

Can you print the entire alphabet with just one loop and without storing characters? Challenge accepted! Task 2 invites you to showcase your loop prowess by printing the ASCII alphabet in lowercase. A single loop, no character storage – feel the elegance of simplicity.

## When I was Having That Alphabet Soup... (Task 3)

**Objective:** More loop mastery

Soup can be a great source of inspiration! Task 3 challenges you to print the ASCII alphabet, excluding specific letters. It's a loop-driven endeavor with a twist. Say goodbye to 'q' and 'e', and embrace the beauty of filtering while printing the alphabet.

## Hexadecimal Printing (Task 4)

**Objective:** Combining loops with string formatting

Now, we venture into hexadecimal territory. Task 4 demonstrates the power of combining loops with string formatting to print numbers in both decimal and hexadecimal. Let the hex magic unfold as we traverse the numerical landscape.

## 00...99 (Task 5)

**Objective:** Mastering loops and string formatting

In Task 5, we print numbers from 0 to 99 in a specific format. Challenge yourself to achieve this without storing numbers or strings, with a limited number of print functions and loops. String formatting takes center stage as we showcase numbers in a neat and organized manner.

## Inventing is a Combination of Brains and Materials... (Task 6)

**Objective:** Complex loop combinations

Creativity blossoms in Task 6 as we generate combinations of two digits. The challenge is to create a program that prints all possible pairs in ascending order without storing numbers or strings excessively. Limited loops, clever combinations – let your coding imagination run wild!

## islower (Task 7)

**Objective:** Introduction to functions

Task 7 marks the introduction of functions. You are tasked with creating a function to check if a character is lowercase. The magic lies in the `ord()` function, providing a gateway to character analysis. Unleash the power of functions and conquer lowercase detection!

## To Uppercase (Task 8)

**Objective:** More functions and string manipulation

Task 8 continues the function journey. This time, the goal is to create a function that prints a string in uppercase. Embrace the challenge of uppercase conversion without using the built-in `str.upper()`. Utilize the `ord()` function creatively and achieve the desired outcome.

## There are Only 3 Colors, 10 Digits, and 7 Notes... (Task 9)

**Objective:** Further function exploration

In Task 9, we delve into functions that print the last digit of a number. The challenge is to extract the last digit without importing any module. Get ready to explore the intriguing world of numbers and their fascinating endings!

## a + b (Task 10)

**Objective:** Function for basic arithmetic

Arithmetic takes center stage in Task 10. You are tasked with creating a function that adds two integers. It's a straightforward yet crucial step in mastering the art of functions and basic arithmetic operations.

## a ^ b (Task 11)

**Objective:** Function for exponentiation

Task 11 builds on the function journey by introducing exponentiation. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a function that computes `a` raised to the power of `b`. Unleash the power of functions in handling more complex mathematical operations.

## Fizz Buzz (Task 12)

**Objective:** Complex loop and condition combination

Task 12 introduces the famous Fizz Buzz challenge. Your goal is to print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of three with "Fizz," multiples of five with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz." It's a fantastic blend of loops and conditions, showcasing your coding versatility.

## Insert in Sorted Linked List (Task 13)

**Objective:** Data structure manipulation

Task 13 invites you to manipulate linked lists. You'll be crafting a function to insert a number into a sorted singly linked list. Dive into the intricacies of linked lists and challenge yourself to maintain order while expanding the list.

## Smile in the Mirror (Task 14)

**Objective:** Advanced loop creativity

Task 14 takes you on an artistic journey. Your mission is to print the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase, creating a visually stunning masterpiece in the console. Feel the joy of mirrored alphabets in this advanced loop challenge.

## Remove at Position (Task 15)

**Objective:** String manipulation

Task 15 introduces string manipulation by challenging you to create a function that removes a character at a specified position. It's a journey into the heart of strings, exploring ways to modify and adapt them based on specific requirements.

## ByteCode -> Python #2 (Task 16)

**Objective:** Bytecode interpretation

The final task, Task 16, brings you into the world of bytecode interpretation. Your mission is to create a Python function that replicates the operations performed by a given Python bytecode. It's a creative challenge that bridges the gap between bytecode and high-level Python functions.

Feel the excitement, embrace the challenge, and embark on this Python adventure! Happy coding! 🚀
